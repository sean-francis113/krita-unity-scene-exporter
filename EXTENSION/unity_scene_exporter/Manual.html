<h3>Unity Scene Exporter Extension</h3>
This extension was created with intended use with a Unity Importer to easily and efficently export out a full 2D Scene from Krita and into Unity.

<h4>Summary of Extension</h4>
<ol>
    <li>This script accesses the active document in Krita and makes sure that the document has layers in it.</li>
    <li>Once it sees that there is an active document and that it has layers, it will duplicate the document, rename it and save it to a specified location (set by the filepath, useFolders and documentFolder variables).</li> 
    <li>Once it has successfully saved the document, it will then open and set active the cloned document.</li>
    <li>From there, it takes all of the top layers (the layers not inside of groups) and removes them completely.</li>
    <li>Then it goes through the rest of the layers (checking to see if there are any more layers), and merges the children of each group.</li>
    <li>After merging, it will export/save the merged layer to a specified location (set by the filepath, useFolders and exportFolder variables) with the specified extension (set by the fileExtension variable).</li>
    <li>After exporting the layer, it will then add information about the layer to an XML String.</li>
    <li>Once all of the layers have been exported properly, it will save the XML String into a XML File and the Log String into a Log File (its extension set by the logExtension variable).</li>
</ol>

<h3>Usage</h3>
The Docker has input fields where you can set various settings such as the file path to save to, file extensions, if you want to use sub folders, and more. 
    
Once those are set, hit the "Export Scene" button and let the script export everything for you!
    
<ul>
    <li><b>Unity Scene Name:</b> Enter the name of the Unity Scene here. The importer will name the created scene based on this name.</li>
    <li><b>Filepath:</b> The base filepath for exported documents.</li>
    <li><b>File Extensions:</b> The extensions of the files that will be exported out (images, XML and Log)</li>
    <li><b>Use Sub-Folders:</b> Check this if you wish to use Sub-Folders for your exports.</li>
    <li><b>Use Batch Mode:</b> Check this if you wish to use Batch Mode (Checked: Export Dialogues will not show; Unchecked: Export Dialogues will show)</li>
    <li><b>Export/Document/Log/XML Folder(s):</b> Specify the names of the sub-folders you would like to save exported files into.</li>
    <li><b>Keywords:</b> The list of keywords you wish the exporter to find to export out. MUST have a comma and space between them, or else the exporter will not find them.</li>    
</ul>
